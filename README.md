I am Omid Karami, an engineer specializing in artificial intelligence and robotics. 
Occasionally, I also work with Python for web development and Django.
The Genos model is a vision project of mine that will be developed in the future,
but it won't be published here :(
because it is a closed-source model. 
This page serves as a showcase for my work in Django and Python, as well as a guide to the knowledge I am currently working on. 
I would appreciate it if you would like to participate
